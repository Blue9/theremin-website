            <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
            <p>Our goal in this project was firstly to design a fully functioning theremin instrument using the
              constraints that were present in the hardware of a Raspberry Pi 3. This includes concurrently reading
              distance values from two sensors over an I2C connection, interpreting user controls, and modulating sound
              waves without noticeable delay. The final product had to combine all these tasks into an expressive and
              responsive system that would be a joy to play.

            </p>
            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
            <p>For our final project, we decided to build a unique musical device that can be played without physical
              contact: a theremin. Our final theremin design’s primary additional features of a tuning mechanism, a
              choice of sounds from a sound bank and a loop pedal.
            </p>

            <h3 id="design">Design and Testing</h3>
            <h4>Sensor Selection</h4>
            <p>In designing our theremin, we needed to choose a method for interpreting the distance between the user’s
              hands and the theremin. The possible methods we came up with were a true analog design and interpreting
              disruptions in an emitted electric field, a computer vision design that used a camera to judge the
              distance to the hands, and a distance sensor that would feed the Raspberry Pi with values representing
              distance to the user’s hands. We chose the very latter of the methods because of the ease at which we
              could assemble our instrument and begin working on the later parts of this project.
            </p>

            <p>The VL53L1X <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14722">distance sensor</a> we ended up choosing
              was a VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) ToF
              (Time of Flight) sensor that was accurate to within a mm within a reasonable distance range (in our case,
              1 - 2 meters).
            </p>

            <h4>Sensor Integration</h4>
            <p>Communications between the Raspberry Pi and a single distance sensor take place completely over the
              SDA/SCL pins on the PI and sensor. Power and ground routed from the Pi provide the requisite 3.3V to
              completely power the sensor. We were able to use a Python library to abstract away sensor setup and common
              actions like checking the current distance measurement. The library we used was stable and made one sensor
              integration quite simple. However, when we sought to connect a second sensor, so that pitch and volume
              could be controlled independently, we ran into our first hurdle.
            </p>

            <p>
              When two sensors were connected to the SDA/SCL pins on our Pi, only one I2C address would appear to be
              occupied when running a native command like “i2cdetect”. After some research, we realized this was because
              the I2C address was being assigned automatically each time the sensor was powered from flash memory. When
              two sensors were powered and connected to the Pi’s I2C pins, they would occupy the same address and create
              a conflict. To solve this issue, we powered off one of the sensors while changing the I2C address of the
              remaining connected sensor.

            </p>

            <p>
              We structured our codebase so that our sensor controls could be captured in an object with function calls
              to retrieve current distances as reported by either sensors. Later on, we would continue to update our
              sensor class so that it would have a “tuning” mechanism and would return a frequency modulation factor
              instead of the new note frequency.

            </p>
